# Story_generating_AI_app

Hey I see you are checking my code.
It's my First React app, so no doubt it might have a lot of bugs and errors.
If you want to make changes you can import the files and give some initial commands on terminal to import some of the important files like node mudule files.
commands:- 1. npm install, in prompt generator folder
           2. npm install, int backend folder
